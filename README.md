# autotraderSeleniumTest
 I worked with a group of eight on SOLR project, implementing Solr to power the search and navigation features of the company website. I mainly focused on catching defects and checking to see whether the refactoring was meeting specified requirements. With the help of my supervisor, I planned manual QA testing to fit developersâ€™ progress, developed automated test scripts with ATC Automation Accelerator, a automation tool supported by KMS Technology, documented statistical quality data and audit findings, and prepared reports to communicate outcomes of quality activities in daily group meeting. Working with the team helped me improve both my verbal and written communication skills. I learnt to pay close attention to details as a Quality Assurance Analyst, which helps me to write cleaner and better code in my future career.
